					<li class = "answers">write a message before you even get home from the date that's at least two iPhone screens long - highlight why you're a perfect match and lay out some days/times they can meet your parents</li>
					<li class = "answers">never - you don't text initiate, you only respond to texts! OH and before you do, you will ask at least 3 friends to curate and then re-read it compulsively to ensure it's right - & repeat with each new reply needed</li>

			    <h5 class = "question">how do you show it?</h5>
				<ul class = "answerlist">
					<li class = "answers">by clinging on for dear life- let the other person know things like: how obsessed with them you are, how many of your past relationships have failed before you found them, and make big vacation plans together for a far off day bc there's no way it won't fail</li>
					<li class = "answers right">by listening, doing small things to make them feel appreciated, and by being there for them even when shitty stuff happens, even it it's inconvenient and uncomfortable for you</li>
					<li class = "answers">never let it show - and in fact, don't even admit it to yourself - that's how you get hurt!</li>
